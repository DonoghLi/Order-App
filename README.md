food search application and just for study.

This is a website for food delivery and I study it from a udemy course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Guide:
1. Download all the files from github.
2. Cd to your directory and make sure you install nodejs and npm.
3. Run "npm install" to install all package we need like webpack and babel
4. Run "npm run start" to start your food search.
